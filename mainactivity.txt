Creating a full-fledged Android and web application for business, financial, and HR management is a complex task that involves multiple stages of development, including planning, designing, coding, testing, and deployment. It also requires a deep understanding of various technologies and programming languages.

For the Android application, you would typically use Java or Kotlin with Android Studio. For the web application, you could use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend language like Python, Java, or PHP. You would also need a database to store your data, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Here's a very high-level overview of what the structure of your application might look like:

1. **User Management**: This would handle user registration, login, and profile management. You would need forms for users to input their information, and this information would be stored in your database.

2. **Business Management**: This could include features like project management, task assignment, and progress tracking. You would need interfaces for creating and managing projects and tasks.

3. **Financial Management**: This might involve tracking income and expenses, generating invoices, and financial reporting. You would need forms for inputting financial data, and this data would be stored in your database.

4. **HR Management**: This could include employee records, payroll, leave management, and more. Again, you would need forms for inputting and managing this data.

5. **Database**: All of this data would need to be stored in a secure and structured way in a database. You would need to design a database schema that effectively represents your data.

Please note that this is a very high-level overview and the actual implementation would be much more complex. If you're new to app development, I would recommend starting with some tutorials or courses to get a feel for it. If you have a specific question or if there's a particular part of the app you'd like help with, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
